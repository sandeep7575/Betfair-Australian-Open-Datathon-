# Sports Modelling -- Tennis Data Modelling
* The data used is collected from the betfair website.
* The data is used to build a model for australian open tennis.

* Project usefulness:
* The project uses tennis data for modelling.
* Feature engineering is done extensively to create new features for the model.
* The data is time series, and hence different techniques are applied before modelling.
* Python3 is used as coding language and jupyter ipnb notebooks as environment.

* Datafiles:
* tennis_modelling.ipnb - pyhton ipnb file containing data processing and model building steps.
* WTA_matches.csv, ATP_matches.csv -- data files.

* How to reproduce the work?
* Diwnload the data files and ipnb file.
* Place them in one folder.
* Use jupyter notebook to run the ipnb file.

* Planned models for phase 2:
* H2o models are used to build the final model.
* SVM code will be updated.
* Artificail neural networks code will be updated.
